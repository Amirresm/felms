every page goes into Scenes folder , and each route have specific folder with its components
if you need global components add them into the scenes/components 
if you need local components add them into local area for any page

remember if you have nested routes like MainPage/Dashboard , 
it's better to make a folder inside MainPage called scenes and 
add your subRoutes and router config
